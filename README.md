# CPUtempAlert
A simple AppleScript Monitor that will alert when CPU temperature is high

For those of you who hate see your MacThing overheating, this script will keep running and alerting when temperature is higher than temperature informed.

It checks the temperature every 5 seconds, and will wait for 5 minutes to alert again when alert is triggered.

Move it to Application folder, for easy access. It's also useful to add into System Preferences --> Users & Groups --> Login Items, to run it after login.

For now, it's depending on User and Password to get privileges and check CPU Temperature. That's all for now. Enjoy!
